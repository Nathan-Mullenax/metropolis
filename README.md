# metropolis
Interpreter for the language 'Metropolis' on esolangs.org. The language was created by Brian Thompson. 

A 'program' is a set of rules describing movement, reading, and writing on a two-dimensional grid of printable ascii characters. The grid is initially filled with spaces.

The language is described here:

The interpreter can be invoked with multiple scripts. All of the scripts will be run in the same grid.

The simulation will run much faster is the camera is off. 

```
Keys:
C - change camera
T - change selected turtle
F3 - show rules
F5 - run
F1 - help
```

Here's what running everything in the 'petri' folder simultaneously looks like on a really big console:
